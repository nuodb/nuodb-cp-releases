            matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
            map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
            operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

A `PATCH` request can be retried without any changes to the request content.
              * `UNKNOWN_REQUEST` - The client request is unroutable due to an unknown content-type, method, or resource path. This can be indicate a versioning issue between the client and server.
